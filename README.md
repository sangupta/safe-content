Blocks unsafe/stupid/non-sense videos for kids on youtube.com.

As a father I have seen an upsurge in videos that make no sense, for example:

* How to be adopted by billionaire parents
* How to become popular by the age of 8

These shitty videos should ideally not even exist. However, I am now fed-up
blocking vidoes for my daughter. All blocking extensions require to configure
setup on same machine. Thus, the need for this extension was born.

This extension reads a list of all users/videos/channels to be blocked via a
hosted URL. This way I can keep adding to list of blocked videos without the need
to configure my kids device everytime.
