Blocks unsafe/stupid/non-sense videos for kids on https://youtube.com.

# Need?

As a father I have seen an upsurge in videos that are too shitty to be watched
by kids, for example:

* I was adopted by billionaire family
* Epic hacks to become popular at school
* Rich vs Poor vs Giga Rich princess
* Hot vs cold prison challenge

These shitty videos should ideally not even exist. However, I am now fed-up
blocking vidoes:

* All blocking extensions require to configure setup on same machine
* Youtube "report" option will just remove it from recommendations
* These child abusers upload these videos from tens/hundreds of different channel names

Thus, the need for this extension was born. This extension reads a list of all 
users/videos/channels to be blocked via a hosted URL. This way I can keep adding 
to list of blocked videos without the need to configure my kids device everytime.

# Why can't I block youtube?

Simple two reasons:

* Chrome does not follow **hosts** file blocking on *youtube.com*
* *youtube.com* is required to Google sign-in
* Teachers at school use learning material from https://youtube.com
